Feedback:
Load test:
- jmx file cant be opened (looks like some additional plugin was used)
- no assertions for http response
- no client-readable reports created

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) To open jmx file, pls follow below steps.

To get additional graphs, pls install additional plugins

Step 1: Add plugin manager to Jmeter by following steps at:
https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/

Step 2: After restarting jmeter from above step, install below plugin 
a) Go to Options -> Plugins Manager
b) Click on "Available Plugins" tab
c) Search for "KPI vs KPI Graphs"
d) Select the checkbox
e) Select "Apply Changes and Restart JMeter" button

Now, we can open LoadTest.jmx

2) Added a text response assertion to check "<title>PHPTRAVELS | Travel Technology Partner</title>"

3) threadsVSresponsetimeGraph.jpg report generated using a reporting plugin


PS: Thanks for noting about adding assertion. Now after adding assertion, noted that, lot of requests were getting redirected and resulted in failures (even though they had 200 response code)
